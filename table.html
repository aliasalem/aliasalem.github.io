 <h2 class="backcolor";> How does social media affect us? </h2>
 
  <p> Teenagers are greatly impacted by social media, there was a survey run by <i> the Royal Society for Public Health </i> which asked 14 to 24 year olds in the UK how social media impacted their health and wellbeing. The results of the survey found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all are leading to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image and loneliness. Social media makes some teenagers feel worthless. </P>
  <blockquote>“In fact, experts worry that the social media and text messages that have become so integral to teenage life are promoting anxiety and lowering self-esteem.”-</blockquote> <a href="https://childmind.org/article/social-media-and-self-doubt/" target="_blank">Social Media and Self-Doubt</a>
