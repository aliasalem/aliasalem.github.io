<h2 class="backcolor";> Social media leading to anxiety </h2>
	<p> Researchers have found that using social media too much causes more than just anxiety. In fact, testing has found that using too much internet can cause depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsive disorder, problems with mental functioning, paranoia, and loneliness. </p>
	<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245251.php" target="_blank">New Psychological Scale</a>
	<blockquote>"We have also found that people who are anxious and socially insecure use Facebook more than those with lower scores on those traits, probably because those who are anxious find it easier to communicate via social media than face-to-face."</blockquote>

	<h2 class="backcolor";> Why do teens use social media?</h2>
<p> Social media can lead to fear of missing out. Most people use social media because they feel if they don’t they are going to miss out, and would not be able to know what the new trends are, and not be able to get invited to events, and overall miss out on life experiences. FOMO is not a thing if you don't know what you are missing out on, if you do not know whats happening you wouldn't care. </P>

	  Negatively;
	  <ol>
<li>Social media is addictive. </li>
<li>Social media makes us compare our lives with others. </li>
<li>Social media makes us restless. Because you stay up till 12 am or more just on your phone probably doing nothing useful just stalking other people and looking at all the fun they have basically comparing your life to others.</li>

		  <h3 class="backcolor";> Positive effects of social media </h3>
		  <p> Social media enhances our connectivity. Social media can help with socialization. It helps people who are shy and do not feel comfortable speaking face to face, behind the screen they feel less anxious talking to people, and helps them be more social. Social media isn’t completely about self-obsessed selfie-takers, cyberbullying, and procrastinating. When used in the right way, it really can achieve what it was first set out to do: connect people. </p>
