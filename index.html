  <h2 style= "color:blue" ;> How does social media affect us? </h2>
 
  <p> Teenagers are greatly impacted by social media, there was a survey run by <i> the Royal Society for Public Health </i> which asked 14 to 24 year olds in the UK how social media impacted their health and wellbeing. The results of the survey found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all are leading to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image and loneliness. Social media makes some teenagers feel worthless. </P>

<h2 style= "color:blue" ;> Why do teens use social media?</h2>
<p> Social media can lead to fear of missing out. Most people use social media because they feel if they don’t they are going to miss out, and would not be able to know what the new trends are, and not be able to get invited to event, and overall miss out on life experiences. FOMO is not a thing if you don't know what you are missing out on, if you dont know whats happening you wouldn't care. </P>
