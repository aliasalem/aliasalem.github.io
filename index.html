<body> <h1>  The Effect of Social Media on Teenagers </h1>
<br>   
  <h2> How does social media affect us? </h2>
 
  <p> Teenagers are greatly impacted by social media, there was a survey run by <i> the Royal Society for Public Health </i> which asked 14 to 24 year olds in the UK how social media impacted their health and wellbeing. The results of the survey found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all are leading to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image and loneliness. Social media makes some teenagers feel worthless. </P>
  <blockquote>“In fact, experts worry that the social media and text messages that have become so integral to teenage life are promoting anxiety and lowering self-esteem.”-</blockquote> <a href="https://childmind.org/article/social-media-and-self-doubt/" target="_blank">Social Media and Self-Doubt</a>

<h2> Social media leading to anxiety </h2>
	<p> Researchers have found that using social media too much causes more than just anxiety. In fact, testing has found that using too much internet can cause depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsive disorder, problems with mental functioning, paranoia, and loneliness. </p>
	<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245251.php" target="_blank">New Psychological Scale</a>
	<blockquote>"We have also found that people who are anxious and socially insecure use Facebook more than those with lower scores on those traits, probably because those who are anxious find it easier to communicate via social media than face-to-face."</blockquote>

	<h2> Why do teens use social media?</h2>
<p> Social media can lead to fear of missing out. Most people use social media because they feel if they don’t they are going to miss out, and would not be able to know what the new trends are, and not be able to get invited to events, and overall miss out on life experiences. FOMO is not a thing if you don't know what you are missing out on, if you do not know whats happening you wouldn't care. </P>

		  <h3 style= "color:blue" ;> Positive effects of social media </h3>
		  <p> Social media enhances our connectivity. Social media can help with socialization. It helps people who are shy and do not feel comfortable speaking face to face, behind the screen they feel less anxious talking to people, and helps them be more social. Social media isn’t completely about self-obsessed selfie-takers, cyberbullying, and procrastinating. When used in the right way, it really can achieve what it was first set out to do: connect people. </p>
