  <h2 class="backcolor";> Social media leading to anxiety </h2>
	<p> Researchers have found that using social media too much causes more than just anxiety. In fact, testing has found that using too much internet can cause depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsive disorder, problems with mental functioning, paranoia, and loneliness. </p>

	<blockquote>"We have also found that people who are anxious and socially insecure use Facebook more than those with lower scores on those traits, probably because those who are anxious find it easier to communicate via social media than face-to-face."</blockquote>

	<h2 class="backcolor";> Why do teens use social media?</h2>
<p> Social media can lead to fear of missing out. Most people use social media because they feel if they donâ€™t they are going to miss out, and would not be able to know what the new trends are, and not be able to get invited to events, and overall miss out on life experiences. FOMO is not a thing if you don't know what you are missing out on, if you do not know whats happening you wouldn't care. </P>
