<h3 class="backcolor";> Positive effects of social media </h3>
		  <p> Social media enhances our connectivity. Social media can help with socialization. 
      It helps people who are shy and do not feel comfortable speaking face to face, behind the screen 
      they feel less anxious talking to people, and helps them be more social. 
      Social media isnâ€™t completely about self-obsessed selfie-takers, cyberbullying, and procrastinating. 
      When used in the right way, it really can achieve what it was first set out to do: connect people. </p>
